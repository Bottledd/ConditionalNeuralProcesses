Tensorflow 2.2 implementation of Conditional Neural Processes (https://deepmind.com/research/open-source/conditional-neural-processes).

Includes extensions to have Attentive (https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.05761) and Convolutional (https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.13556) representations.

Attentive mechanism uses code from https://github.com/CyberZHG/keras-self-attention and https://github.com/CyberZHG/keras-multi-head but can be implemented using Keras with Tensorflow 2.4.
